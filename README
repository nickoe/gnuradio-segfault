Origninal problem found in AAUSAT4_Receiver.grc from
https://github.com/nickoe/aausat4_beacon_parser/tree/refactor

I made a minimal example as untitled2.grc

I am on archlinux using gnuradio 3.7.10-1 and libvolk 1.3-1.

miek from #hackrf was also able to reproduce my problem on ubuntu
16.04.

He found:
[01:28:48] <miek> nickoe: seems unrelated to volk in the end. stepping
up a few frames into clock_recovery_mm_ff_impl::general_work shows
'ii' being -1632 which shouldn't happen, which causes the segfault
later on when &in[ii] is dereferenced. don't think i'll go much
further tonight though

The same flowgraph used to work a few months ago.

It seems that libvolk was upgraded recently:
[2016-07-12 20:19] [ALPM] upgraded libvolk (1.2.2-1 -> 1.3-1)
